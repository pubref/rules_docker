# `rules_docker` (Î±lpha) [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/pubref/rules_docker.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/pubref/rules_docker)

These are respository rules for building deterministic base docker
images with bazel.  Bazel provides fantastic support for this with the
`docker_build` command.  This command removes timestamps and other
non-deterministic data in order to repeatably build images based on
content alone.

In practice however, using `docker_build` is challenging as one is
expected to build images based on vendoring of layers via `deb`
archives.  This makes it hard to use distros that use different
packaging systems such as Alpine Linux.

The idea with these rules is that you build a construct a root
filesystem based on a Dockerfile instructions and then layer on build
artifacts rather than debs or other fs layers.

| Rule | Description |
| ---  | ---- |
| `docker_repositories` | Loads and workspace dependencies for rules_docker to work.  Currently this is none. |
| `docker_rootfs` | Provides a rootfs from the `docker export` command. |
| `docker_rootfs_http_file` | Provides a rootfs from a file fetched via http. |
| `docker_rootfs_github_repository` | Provides a rootfs from a github repository. |
| `docker_build` | Macro that calls the `@bazel_tools//tools/docker/docker_build.bzl` rule with an alternative `incremental_load.sh.tpl` template file. |

> You must have `docker` running, bazel won't download/install it for
> you at the moment.  Require bazel 0.3.1 or HEAD is required (fails
> with 0.3.0).

# Step 1: Add rules_docker to your workspace

```python
git_repository(
    name = "org_pubref_rules_docker",
    commit = "COMMIT_ID",
    remote = "https://github.com/pubref/rules_docker.git",
)
load("@org_pubref_rules_docker//docker:rules.bzl",
     "docker_repositories",
     "docker_rootfs",
     # "docker_rootfs_http_file",
     # "docker_rootfs_github_repository",
)
docker_repositories()
```

# Step 2: Add docker_rootfs rules to your workspace

Example repository rule to generate a rootfs.tar from the busybox
image.  The image becomes available at @busybox//:base.

```python
docker_rootfs(
    name = "busybox",
    dockerfile_content = "FROM busybox",
)
```

Later, in a BUILD file:

```python
load("@org_pubref_rules_docker//docker:rules.bzl", "docker_build")

docker_build(
    name = "foo",
    base = "@busybox//:base",
    ...
)
```

Then generate and run a deterministic docker image with:

```sh
$ bazel run :foo gcr.io/example:busybox
$ docker run -it gcr.io/example:busybox sh
```

---

One can also directly use the targets provided by this workspace:

```sh
$  bazel query //... --output label_kind
docker_build  rule  //alpine:3_4
docker_build  rule  //alpine:alpine
docker_build  rule  //alpine:edge
docker_build  rule  //alpine:go
docker_build  rule  //alpine:java8
docker_build  rule  //debian:wheezy
docker_build  rule  //docker:scratch
docker_build  rule  //ubuntu:trusty
```
